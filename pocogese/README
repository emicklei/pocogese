Pocogese is a lightweight framework to facilitate the communication between an Adobe Flex Application and Rails or Java-based Webservices.
Pocogese implements the concept of Commands and Selections applied to the remote invocation of services. 
Its design is based on the observation that services either read or manipulate resources. 

Reading is realized by sending GET requests with selections ; these should not change the state of the resource requested.
Selections return with a single resource or a list of resources based on some selection criteria.

Manipulation is realized by sending POST requests with commands ; these change the state of one or multiple resources.
Typical commands include create,update and delete, but any other modifying action can be modelled this way.
Commands return with information about the status of the manipulation and may include a result and explanation messages.
